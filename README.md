TermColor is a class library which takes responsibility for bufferring colored text
before displaying it to the terminal. It supports multiple color modes, and different
platforms (Windows, Unix).

## Features

- Fast terminal buffering, can be used for real-time animation in the terminal.
- Support of Windows Console API for faster display of the buffer.
- Outputs colored text formatted with [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).
- 4 different color modes (see image). In `Dither4bit` mode, `â–‘â–’â–“` characters are used to mix different colors using just the basic 16-color palette.

This is a demo showing a slice of the HSV cone in all four different color modes.

## Getting started

Create an instance of TermColor.Terminal. It has similar interface to `System.Console`.
You can write colored text to it, and then flush it all at once to the console window,
or to other outputs.

```cs
var term = new Terminal();

term.ForegroundColor = (Color4)ConsoleColor.Green;
term.WriteLine("Hello, world!");

term.Flush();
```

Output:

![Hello world](images/hello_world.png)
